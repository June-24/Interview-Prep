question: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/move-all-negative-elements-to-end1813/1
easily do it in n time by reading the input and 
but we need to see two pointer approach to this
normal way is really naive that just traverses the array 
and keeps positive in another array and the ngative later

no point doing like that
need to see two pointer approach
if order was not needed then we could directly use two pointers a
at two ends and keep swapping
but this is diff


nopenopenope
just do basic put in array and put out
no other way
